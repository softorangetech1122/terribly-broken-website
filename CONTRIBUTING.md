# Contributing to this project
ðŸ˜ŠThanks for looking to Contribute on this project! Here are some guidelines that you need to know.

## Types of Contributions (for beginners)
Contributions can be ideas and pull requests.
- "Ideas" mean that you have not created the feature, but are asking the team to do so. Also called "suggesting, suggestions".
- "Pull requests" mean that you have created the feature yourself, and are asking for team reviews of your changes. Outside of GitHub, also called "Merge requests".

## How to Contribute
### Pull Requests aka Merge Requests
To create a pull request, you'll have to [fork](https://github.com/softorangetech200/terribly-broken-website/fork) the repository to make your changes to.

Next, create a new branch. This allows you to create multiple pull requests without making organization forks. You can call it whatever you want (e.g. bug/fix-55).

Next, commit your changes. A lot of people are expected to use the built-in code editor inside the GitHub web interface.

Optionally, preview your changes. If you like you can use the deployment of the fork by going to **Settings** then **Pages** and deploying your fork temporarily. After your commits have deployed, use the preview link to view your changes (used in syntax https://YOURUSERNAME.github.io/YOURREPONAME (YOURUSERNAME is the GitHub username for your account, YOURREPONAME can be **terribly-broken-website** or **repo name in the fork** (they can be different)).

Then create your pull request by clicking [here](https://github.com/softorangetech200/terribly-broken-website/compare) and following the steps shown.

### Ideas aka Suggesting, Suggestions
